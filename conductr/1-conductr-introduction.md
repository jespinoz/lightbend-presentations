# ConductR roadmap

- Bundle affinity
  - _the ability to declare that a bundle should run alongside another bundle_
- Bundle monitoring and auto scaling
  - _a bundle publishes metrics regarding its performance and a separate service acts upon this data to auto-scale bundles_
- Mesos / DCOS integration
