# Lightbend Presales Presentations

Mix and match presentations in Markdown to accelerate building a presales deck. Browse each component of our platform, and for each presales unique presales presentation, combine the various individual Markdown files to build your deck. (Your deck should not be committed back to Git, only updates that can be used by all of us.)

Any new files should be in Markdown format and compatable with [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/). 

These should roughly stick to the platform itself. Perhaps for more conceptual topics we create a new repo.
