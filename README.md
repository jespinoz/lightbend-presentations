# Lightbend Technical Presentations

Mix and match presentations in Markdown to accelerate building a Lightbend technology deck. 

For each presales unique technical presentation, combine the various individual Markdown files to build your deck. Any new files should be in Markdown format and compatible with [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/). 

## Look and feel

These Decks have been individually formatted to work with Deckset app and the "Letters from Sweden" theme with a white background. 

Care should be taken to ensure we standardize on the theme so text and images fit properly.

## Images

Images should not be checked into this repo. They should be public, e.g, via Dropbox (shared), Cloudinary, etc. 

### Requesting new images

Feel free to build out a deck and leave placeholders for new images. We can add these to issues. The look and feel should stay consistent.
