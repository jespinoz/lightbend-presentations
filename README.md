# Lightbend Presales Presentations

Mix and match presentations in Markdown to accelerate building a presales deck. 

Browse each component of our platform, and for each presales unique presales presentation, combine the various individual Markdown files to build your deck. (Your deck should not be committed back to Git, only updates that can be used by all of us.)

Any new files should be in Markdown format and compatible with [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/). 

These should roughly stick to the platform itself. Perhaps for more conceptual topics we create a new repo.

## Look and feel

These Decks have been individually formatted to work with Deckset app and the "Letters from Sweden" theme with a white background. 

Care should be taken to ensure we standardize on the theme so text and images fit properly.

## Images

Images should not be checked into this repo. They should be public, e.g, via Dropbox (shared), Cloudinary, etc. We can standardize on an image repo at a later date.

### Requesting new images

Feel free to build out a deck and leave placeholders for new images. We can add these to issues. The look and feel should stay consistent.
